<h2 style="color: #fee440;"> Lessons Learned </h1>

File operations can be quite challenging because sometimes I got errors in the file path.

I also learned and used the use of recursive functions with this project.

Recursive functions are functions that call themselves and solve the process by dividing it into smaller sub-problems. This approach allows to break complex problems into more understandable and manageable parts. But the important thing is that the recursive function includes a termination condition and continues to call itself until this condition occurs.
